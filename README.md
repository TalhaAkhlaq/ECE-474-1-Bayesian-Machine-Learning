# Bayesian Machine Learning

This repository contains coursework and projects from **ECE 474: Bayesian Machine Learning**. The course applies probabilistic modeling to machine-learning problems, deriving algorithms analytically and implementing them in Python.

## Course Overview
* **Conjugate Priors** – analytical posteriors for exponential-family likelihoods  
* **Bayesian Linear Regression** – posterior weight distribution, predictive uncertainty, model evidence  
* **Generative Linear Classification** – class-conditional modeling, Bayesian decision rule  
* **Logistic Regression (Laplace Approximation)** – posterior mode, Gaussian approximation, evidence maximization  
* **Kernel Methods & Gaussian Processes** – non-parametric regression, covariance functions, hyper-parameter marginalization  
* **Mixture Models & Expectation–Maximization** – latent-variable inference, model selection criteria  
* **Hidden Markov Models** – forward–backward, Viterbi decoding, Baum–Welch learning  
* **Sampling & Markov Chain Monte Carlo** – Gibbs, Metropolis–Hastings, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, convergence diagnostics

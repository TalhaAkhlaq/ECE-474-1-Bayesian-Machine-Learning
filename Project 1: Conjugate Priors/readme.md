# Conjugate Estimators

## Project Description
Implement Bayesian conjugate estimators for three canonical inference problems:

- **Binomial** — Beta prior on \(p\).
- **Gaussian with known variance** — Gaussian prior on \(\mu\).
- **Gaussian with known mean** — Inverse-Gamma prior on \(\sigma^{2}\).

## Tasks
1. Plot the mean-squared error of the maximum-likelihood estimate and the posterior mean estimate on a single figure with a legend. Use 2–3 distinct hyper-parameter settings per scenario.  
2. For at least one hyper-parameter setting in each scenario, show how the posterior density evolves by plotting the pdf after several observation counts.

## Stretch Goals
- Make an animation that shows the posterior converging.  
- Extend to the unknown-mean-and-variance case using the Normal–Inverse-Gamma prior and visualize the evolving joint posterior with a heatmap or similar plot.
